  displayName: Xenomorph Queen
  difficulty: 4
  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Lead your Hive to victory over the Marines."
  descriptionLong: 'The Queen is the most vital member of the hive. But with great
    power comes great responsibility, and she''s often misused. Evolved from a Drone,
    the Queen is the mind of the Hive. Comparable to the Marine Commanding Officer,
    her primary function is to lead the Hive. Communication is key, and the Hive
    must follow her orders.

    One definitive feature of the Queen is her ability
    to grow an ovipositor and lay eggs. Those eggs must be picked up and planted
    on weeds by the hive castes Eggs can only be planted near the queen in ovi. In
    the egg-laying mode, the Queen can toggle a more extensive vision mode, and she
    can overwatch an alien. '
