    Frost, regarding Lieutenant Gorman, Aliens\nYou are the Executive Officer (A.K.A
    The X.O.) the second in command of the Marines. You have been tasked with the
    same objective as the Commanding Officer, you're both there to command the marines.
    If there is no Commanding Officer alive or available you are next in line to
    be in command of the marines to brief them on the mission and command them. You
    can go down to the FOB if there is one setup to further command the marines BUT
    the Commanding Officer must stay onboard the Almayer. The Commanding Officer
    is to stay on the Almayer until you have returned to the ship and vice versa
    for the Commanding Officer."
