  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Operate the M34A2 Longstreet Light Tank or M577 Armored
    Personnel Carrier."
  descriptionLong: '"The Ridge'' is a scary tank. Its got stealth, mobility, firepower
    and point defenses better''n anything we had on the M22. What''s so neat is the
    way the automatics handle the workload - you''d think you need at least three
    crew to run all this crap, but in fact you can do it with the same two girls
    you had in the Jackson. The only problem we had in our battalion was running
    the panzers in after they were delivered, factory fresh - you need to fire the
    guns a lot and run all the equipment a number of times before the sensors and
    weapons settle down and fully integrate." - Capt. Andrea Mae Samona, 2nd Colonial
    Marine Tank Battalion, Colonial Marines Tech Manual'
