  difficulty: 2
  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Provide overwatch.\n\u2022 Assist the Commanding Officer."
  descriptionLong: Staff Officers (SO) are sixth in command after the Chief Engineer
    (CE), Requisitions Officer (RO) and Chief MP (CMP). Despite being the 6th in
    line for Command, generally when there is no CO or XO, the role of Acting Commanding
    Officer will pass down to you since other department heads are too busy in their
    own department. A SO's primary objective is to support the marine squads using
    the Overwatch Consoles and to communicate with the crew of the ship so that key
    information can be relayed to all personnel, an example for this would be relaying
    to the doctors that there are injured about to land on the Almayer aboard the
    Normandy. Overwatch allows for you and the other command personnel to oversee
    squad operations from the safety of the Combat Information Centre (CIC).
