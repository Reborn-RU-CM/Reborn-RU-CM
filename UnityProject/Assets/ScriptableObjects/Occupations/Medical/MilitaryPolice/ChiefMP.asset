    "Dura Lex, Sed Lex" ("The law is harsh, but it is the
    law") - Ancient Roman proverb


    As the Chief MP, your main duty is to ensure
    Marine Law is being properly enforced. You are the second to the final authority
    on Marine Law aboard the ship, but with that authority comes responsibility.
    You''re responsible for ensuring all prisoners are safe, given proper sentencing
    and that their rights are not violated. You may perform arrests yourself if needed,
    but you shouldn''t be running about investigating crimes and chasing perps. You''re
    much more valuable at the brig, coordinating and ensuring no breaches of procedure
    occur, leave the grunt work to the grunts.'
