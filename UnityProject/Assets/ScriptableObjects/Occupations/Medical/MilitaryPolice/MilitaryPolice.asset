    are held to a very high standard of conduct because you are the source of in-character
    discipline as well as the server's first line of defense against out-of-character
    infractions. You are bound to Marine Law as Server Rules meaning if you break
    any laws in Marine Law you risk being punished outside of \"In Character\", meaning
    you may be Job banned or even outright banned due to your actions.\r"
