  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Lead your team.\n\u2022 Follow orders from command."
  descriptionLong: "\"All right, sweethearts, what are you waiting for? Breakfast
    in bed? It's another glorious day in the Corps. A day in the Marine Corps is
    like a day on the farm: Every meal's a banquet. Every paycheck a fortune! Every
    formation's a parade! I love the Corps!\" - Gunnery Sergeant Apone, Aliens\r\n\rYou
    are the Squad Leader (SL) of one of the main squads aboard the USS Almayer. You
    are entrusted with the lives of your soldiers, the men and women you will be
    fighting with on the frontiers of space, and the battlefields on various stations
    and colonies. You're the one keeping your squad together, so do it right. Your
    role is primarily Leadership and only secondarily combat. You're practically
    the only one with a brain down there, so you should do most of the thinking,
    and let your marines do most of the shooting. Don't leave your squad leaderless
    by ramboing into combat and becoming a casualty. It's important to know when
    to fall back. Ensure that your squad makes it back in one piece.\r\n"
