    sergeant's orders."
  descriptionLong: "But the good news \u2014 we got four of these robot sentries
    with display and scanners intact. They really kick ass, I think they'll come
    in handy. \u2015Corporal Hicks, Aliens\r\n\r\nAs a Squad Engineer, your main
    goals will be fixing power, getting through doors, and setting up fortifications
    for a FOB (Forward Operating Base) that'll be used for defense and to secure
    a supply route. Without you, your platoon will have no power or a FOB which is
    critical for mission success."
