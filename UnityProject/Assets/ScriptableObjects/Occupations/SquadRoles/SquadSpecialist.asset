  descriptionLong: "\n\"Independently targeting particle beam phalanx. Vwap! Fry
    half a city with this puppy. We got tactical smart missiles, phased plasma pulse
    rifles, RPGs, we got sonic electronic ball breakers! We got nukes, we got knives,
    sharp sticks... \" \u2015Pvt. Hudson, Aliens\r\n\rSome drops, you kick in the
    door and find out that the distress call was a false alarm. Other days you drop
    in and clear the problem and move on. Some drops, you gotta kill the whole damn
    planet. That's where you (the Specialist) come in. Each squad is deployed with
    a single specialist trained in the use of a squad support weapon. These range
    from the M42A Scoped Rifle to the devastating M5 RPG."
