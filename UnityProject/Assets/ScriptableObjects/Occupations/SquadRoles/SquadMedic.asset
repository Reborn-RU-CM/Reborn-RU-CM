  displayName: Squad Medic
  difficulty: 3
  descriptionShort: "\u2022 Assist squad.\n\u2022 Heal your squad.\n\u2022 Follow
    your sergeant's orders."
  descriptionLong: "As the Squad Medic, you are your squad's main source of first
    aid and battlefield triage. While Marines usually try to keep themselves out
    of harm's way, your actions will often decide who lives and dies that day. Wherever
    it is administering first aid, popping painkillers for a wounded comrade, performing
    a medevac, or even bringing someone back from the brink of death, you will often
    be the lifeline of your squad. Without you on your squad's side, only pain and
    death await.\r\n\r\rAs a Squad Medic, you will be placed under a lot of stress.
    Your entire squad, and often even the entire Marine force, will rely on you to
    stay in fighting condition and perform medical procedures correctly and rapidly.
    You will probably mess up your first few deployments, patients will die in your
    hands, casualties will overwhelm you, supplies will get misplaced or dropped,
    and hostiles will get the jump on you and eliminate you, but practice makes perfect.
    If needed, consult this guide and/or the forum guides linked below whenever you
    require and mentorhelp if any doubts arise, and remember that all Squad Medics
    started here."
