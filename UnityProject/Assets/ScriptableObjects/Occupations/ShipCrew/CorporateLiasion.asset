    an OK guy!\" \u2015Burke, Aliens\n\nAs the Corporate Liaison, it is your job
    to represent the Weston-Yamada's interests in the mission that has been given
    to the United States Colonial Marine Corp. You have ZERO direct authority over
    the Marine Corp, you merely have influence, stretching this influence too far
    is likely to result in detainment or possibly abandonment on the planet. You
    may make requests to the Commanding Officer and Executive Officer, but there
    is no guarantee that they will give you what you want. If you need something,
    fax Weston-Yamada for it. They are listening and may be happy to help. Have an
    issue with a Colonial Marine employee? Fax a complaint over to USCM High Command."
