  descriptionLong: "\"I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.\" \u2015Bishop, Aliens\n\nA
    Synthetic is a biomechanical humanoid that closely emulates humans in appearance
    and actions; however there is one key difference synthetics aren't affected by
    emotions in their decision making. Due to emotions not having an effect on them,
    synthetics have been seen as more reliable in high stress and dangerous environments,
    such as aboard a military vessel. A medical or xeno hud will show a grey box
    with a \"meh\" face inside of it."
